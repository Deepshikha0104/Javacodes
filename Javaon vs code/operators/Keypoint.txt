1. What are logical operators in Java?

Answer: Logical operators are used to combine multiple conditions and return a true or false result. They help create complex decision-making scenarios in your code.

2. What does the && operator do?

Answer: The && (Logical AND) operator returns true only if both conditions are true. If either condition is false, it returns false.

3. How is the || operator different from &&?

Answer: The || (Logical OR) operator returns true if at least one of the conditions is true, whereas && requires both conditions to be true.

4. What is the purpose of the operator?

Answer: The I (Logical NOT) operator inverts a condition, changing true to false and vice versa.

5. Can logical operators be combined?

Answer: Yes, logical operators can be combined to create more complex conditions, allowing for sophisticated decision-making in code.

Summary of Key Points

• Logical operators help combine multiple conditions, making your code smarter and capable of handling complex decisions.

The Logical AND (88) operator requires both conditions to be true.

The Logical OR (||) operator requires at least one condition to be true.

The Logical NOT (1) operator flips the condition, turning true into false and vice versa.

Logical operators are essential for creating complex conditions and making more nuanced decisions in programming.
