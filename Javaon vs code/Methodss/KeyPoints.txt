1.  What is a method in java?
Answer:  A method in java is a block of code that performs a specific tasks.
It helps organize code, makes it reusable, and improves readability.

2. difference b/w void and returns methods?
Answer:  A void method does not return anything, while a return method gives back a value after execution.

3.  What is parameters in a method?
Answer:  parameters are values or arguments passed to a method that it uses to perform its tasks. 

4.  Why should we use methods in programming?
Answer:  methods help in breaking down large tasks into smaller parts, reducing code repetition, and making the code
 easier to understand and maintain.

5. What are Methods with parameters but without return values?
Answer:  take input values,dont return anything. perform specific tasks with the provided inputs.

6. Why are parameters important in methods?
Answer:  parameters allow methods to be more flexible and customizable. Instead of writing the same logic repeatedly,
 can write a single method and pass different parameters each time to perform different actions.

7. Benefit of using void methodswith parameters?
Answer:  The Benefit is that you can make your code more dynamic by using parameters to change the methods behaviour,
 while keeping your code neat and reducing redundancy.

KEYPOINTS

-> methods are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks.
-> They help avoid repetition and make your code cleaner and more organized.
-> Can write void methods(no return type) or return methods(that give something back).
-> parameters are like inputs that a method needs to perform its task.
-> There are four types of methods based on whether they take parameters and/or return values.
->  Methods without parameters and without return values perform actions without taking in any information or returning
     any results.
-> They help make code reusable, organize and easy to maintain.
-> perfect for consistent tasks.
-> methods with parameters but without return values take input but dont return anything.
-> Great for tasks where you need customization, like sending personalized message or preparing different types of chai.
-> help reduce code repetition, make program more organized and easy to understand.
-> passing parameters is like giving the method specific instructions to do.
